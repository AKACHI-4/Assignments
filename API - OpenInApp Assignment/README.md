# Task-In-App: Open-In-App Task API Assignment

#### [Demo Video Link](https://streamyard.com/73a9wy5g9sar)  
- The video is a bit faded and laggy, sorry for that. I do not have a powerful enough PC to run two consuming tasks simultaneously, though sometimes it happens.

#### [Postman API Collection](./public/TaskInApp.postman_collection.json)
- I am using environment keys; however, you can define yours also using the environments section in the Postman workspace.

### Setup

- Make sure to put all the keys into the [demo.env](/demo.env) and change the name to `.env`.

- Run the command:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Run the server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
