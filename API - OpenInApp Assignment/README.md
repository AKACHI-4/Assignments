  - I am using environment keys though, you can define yours also using the environments section in the postman workspace

### Setup

  - Make sure to put all the keys into the [demo.env](/demo.env) and change name to `.env`

  - run the command
    ```js
      npm install
    ```

  - run the server
    ```js
      npm run dev
    ```
